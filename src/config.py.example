"""
config.py.example — Pilot AI Meeting Assistant

SETUP INSTRUCTIONS
------------------
This file shows every user-customizable setting. You do NOT edit this file.
Instead, set values in your .env file (for secrets + identity) or config.ini
(for hardware/behaviour tweaks). This file documents what each setting does.

MINIMUM REQUIRED SETUP
-----------------------
1. Copy .env.example to .env
2. Add your API keys to .env
3. Set MY_NAME (and optionally other identity fields) in .env
4. Run: python -m src.main

OPTIONAL: CUSTOM AI CONTEXT
----------------------------
For domain-specific meetings (medical, legal, tech, etc.) set
PILOT_SYSTEM_CONTEXT in .env to a string that describes your role and
domain. Example below. If you leave it unset, Pilot builds a generic
context from the individual identity fields.

# IDENTITY SETTINGS — set these in .env

# Pilot uses this to detect when you're assigned an action item.

MY_NAME_VARIATIONS = "YourName,CommonMisspelling"
# Comma-separated name variations. Add phonetic misspellings that
# your speech-to-text might produce (e.g. "Alex,Alec,Aleks").

MY_MANAGER_NAME = "ManagerName"
# Your manager's name. Items they assign or approve are flagged.

MY_COLLEAGUE_NAME = "ColleagueName"
# A key colleague on your team. Add more via PILOT_SYSTEM_CONTEXT.

# ============================================================
# CUSTOM AI CONTEXT (optional but recommended)
# ============================================================
